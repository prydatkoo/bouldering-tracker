      bouldering session logger, which allows users to log their climbing
      sessions, track their progress, and share their achievements with friends.
      The application will have a user-friendly interface and will be built
      using modern web technologies. Users will be able to create an account,
      log their climbs, and view their climbing history. The application will
      also include features such as a climbing route database, a social feed for
      sharing achievements, and a progress tracker to help climbers set and
      achieve their goals.
